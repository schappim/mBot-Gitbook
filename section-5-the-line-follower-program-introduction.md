## Chapter 25: The line follower program

---

### This chapter is a an introduction to a new section {#this-chapter-is-a-recap-of-what-you-have-learned-so-far}

There are no hands-on activities in this chapter.

In this section you will learn  how to use the line sensor. We'll start putting together everything we learned up to now in order to construct, step-by-step, a line-following program.

In addition, we will introduce the use of a button and will learn how to create custom Scratch blocks, which is the equivalent of a programming function or subroutine. Using custom blocks is a good practice for when our programs become large.

By the end of this section, we will have an mBot that can follow a line, detect the end of that line, and even do a U-turn.

This book contains line segments that can be torn out and then put together in order to construct a line on the floor for the mBot to follow.
