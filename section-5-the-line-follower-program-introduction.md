## Chapter 25: The line follower program

---

### This chapter is a an introduction to a new section {#this-chapter-is-a-recap-of-what-you-have-learned-so-far}

There are no hands-on activities in this chapter.

---

In this section you will start by learning how to use the line sensor. The line sensor is at the core of the line follower program that you will work on in the bulk of this section. 

You will also learn how to use the button button that comes with the mCore controller, and how to create custom Scratch blocks. Custom Scratch blocks is the equivalent of a programming function or subroutine. Using custom blocks is a good practice for when our programs become large.

By the end of this section, we will have an mBot that can follow a line, detect the end of that line, and even do a U-turn.

This book contains line segments that can be torn out and then put together in order to construct a line on the floor for the mBot to follow.
