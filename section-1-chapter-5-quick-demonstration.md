Now that your mBot is assembled, how about your take it for a ride? You don't have to do any programming at all, because the mBot comes with demonstration programs already installed, out of the box. To play with them, you will need your mBot infrared remote control and the fold-out sheet of paper with the black line printed on it that is included in the kit.

Let's start with the first demonstration mode: remote control car!

Turn on your mBot and place it on the floor. Make sure the the coin-cell battery is properly inserted in the remote controller. Then, point the remote controller towards the mBot, and press the "A" key. This will enables the remote control car mode.

Now press any of the directional keys, and see how your mBot responds by moving accordingly. Have a bit of fun with this mode before moving to the next one.



All right. I'm going to plug in the power supply as well. The barrel connector will go to the six volts. And turn it on. Right, good power. Now, just to check that the mBot is operating, I'm going to unpack my remote control. It doesn't come with a battery, so I need to get a battery for this. I don't believe that a battery is supplied. No. Let's get the batteries in. I've got a fresh CR2025 Lithium battery, so plug it in the holder and insert it into the remote control, like that.

Now, face the-- I will point my remote control to the infrared receiver, although it's pretty good so it can actually operate your mBot with a remote control from a large range of angles towards it. If I press the A button, that activates the manual control program. So then you can see that I can use the directional keys to move my mBot to a particular direction. Another program that is fun for people to use right out of the box is the line following program.

Just make a little bit of room here. I'm just going to have a look at a segment of the line that is printed on the sheet of paper that comes with the box, let's say this bit. I'm going to place my mBot, say here, and then instruct it to follow the line by pressing the C button. There you go. This is as fast as you can go. Let's try the other side. All right.

I will stop it by pressing A and going back into manual mode. This is a good fun thing to play with right away. Just spread this on the floor and let your mBot loose. There's another one, another interesting mode which you can activate by pressing B. That is the obstacle avoidance mode. The mBot will use it's range finder to avoid any obstacles. Whenever it detects an obstacle, it will reverse, then it will turn, and then try to go forwards again.

Good fun. Get it back to manual mode. All right, there we go, back to manual mode. I encourage you to play around with your mBot and the programs that come with it at available budgets using the A, B and C buttons on your remote control and the directional buttons so as to control its direction.

In the next lecture, I'm going to show you how you can do some simple programming on the mBot using the Scratch graphical programming language on an iPad.
