## Chapter 5: A quick demonstration

---

In this chapter you will learn about:

* How to use the remote controller for starting one of the demo programs that ship with the mBot

---

Now that your mBot is assembled, how about your take it for a ride? You don't have to do any programming at all, because the mBot comes with demonstration programs already installed, out of the box. To play with them, you will need your mBot infrared remote control and the fold-out sheet of paper with the black line printed on it that is included in the kit.

Let's start with the first demonstration mode: remote control car!

Turn on your mBot and place it on the floor. Make sure the the coin-cell \(CR2025\) battery is properly inserted in the remote controller. Then, point the remote controller towards the mBot, and press the "A" key. This will enables the remote control car mode.

Now press any of the directional keys, and see how your mBot responds by moving accordingly. Have a bit of fun with this mode before moving to the next one.

Put a few objects on the floor around your mBot, and press the "B" key on the remote controller. This will start the obstacle avoidance program. Your mBot will start moving at a straight line, but as soon as it gets close to an obstacle it will stop and turn to a different direction, then move forwards again. It will keep doing that until you turn it off, or change the program that is running on it.

The obstacle avoidance program uses the rangefinder module to detect obstacles in front of it, and changes course when it gets to close to one of them. Later in this book you will learn how to program this kind of behaviour.

Next, try out the line follower program. Place the supplied sheet of paper with the large "8" figure printed on it on the floor, and place your mBot somewhere on the line. The line module should be over the line. Turn the mBot on and press the "C" key on the remote controller.

The mBot will start zooming over the line, without going off it. It will keep going until you press "A" to enable the remote control program again.

How about you create your own line on the floor?

**You can use the line segments that we supply at the end of this book**, or print yours out and create any kind of line you like for your mBot to follow. Here's one I made:

In the later part of this book you will learn how to implement this kind of behaviour on your mBot. Yes, you will learn how to program your mBot to follow a line!

Fun, isn't it? To stop the mBot, press the "A" button on the remote controller to go back into manual control mode.I encourage you to play around with your mBot and the programs that come with it at available budgets using the A, B and C buttons on your remote control and the directional buttons so as to control its direction.

In the next chapter, I'm going to show you how you can do some simple programming on the mBot using the Scratch graphical programming language on an iPad.
