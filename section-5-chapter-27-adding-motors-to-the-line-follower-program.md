## Chapter 27: Adding the motors

---

In this chapter you will learn about:

* How to use the motors to control the movement of the mBot using input from the line follower module

---

**This chapter contains hands-on activities.**

You will need your mBot, and a fresh set of batteries installed.

You will need the mBlock software installed on your computer.

In this chapter you will learn how to take input from the line follower module and use it to control the motors so that your mBot can move forwards while staying on the path that the line forms.

---

It's about time to get the wheel motors moving. We are going to work on the program that we created in the previous chapter and just modify it slightly.

If we think about what LEDs and motors have in common, we might say that they're both output devices, actuators: they both modify the world in some way. The motors by producing motion and the LEDs by producing light.

In that effect, the structure of the program, as we have it by now, is ready to go. All we have to do is place the motor movement instructions next to the LED ones.

Let's think about how to approach it.

### **Reacting to the readings**

When the line-follower module reports 0, we know that the mBot must be fully within the track and all it has to do really is just move forwards. No need to adjust its course.

When the line-follower module reports 1, that means that the right sensor got outside the line and we should turn the mBot a little to the left, to get both sensors inside the line and the robot back on track, again.

When the line-follower module reports 2, that means that the left sensor got outside the line and we should turn the mBot a little to the right.

Finally, when the line-follower module reports 3, then the mBot got way outside the line and maybe the best idea is to get it to move backwards hoping to meet the line again.

### **Expanding the program**

All the above seems straightforward and here is how we can implement it.

First of all we need a variable in order to set a fixed speed for the motors, that we can use within the program. So, letâ€™s create a variable and call it "speed", and set it to some speed, say 150.

For the rest we will need the "\[run forward\] at speed \[0\]" instruction block, that can be found in the "Robots" instruction family.

\[Image 5.27.1: The "\[run forward\] at speed \[0\]" instruction block\]

The first attribute of this block can be altered to make the mBot move either forwards or backwards and turn either left or right. As for the second attribute, we will set it to variable "speed".

Here is how we must modify the program:![](/assets/Img.5.27.2.jpg)\[Image 5.27.2: The program\]

The modifications are pointed at, to make it easier to spot them:

\(1\) is where variable "speed" is set to 150.

\(2\) is where the motor moving blocks are added

What happens here is that every time we get a reading from the line follower module, we decide as to how the mBot must move. If things look good, it just moves forwards. If one sensor seems to be outside the line, we turn the mBot, to get it back on track. If both sensors are outside the line, we move the mBot backwards, hoping to meet the line again, since the best chance is that the line is behind it.

Let's get ready to test the program now:

* First we make sure we have composed a line runway on some spacy surface, like the floor.
* Then we connect the mBot to the computer and "Upload to Arduino" and then we can switch it off, so that we can place it at the beginning of the line.
* And then, we can switch it on and see if it behaves as expected.

As can be seen in the image above, we can place obstacles to mark the start and finish of the runway. These will prove useful in the improvements we are going to apply to the program in the next chapter.

If we turn the mBot on, we will see it get going, following the line by constantly adjusting its route, until finally it reaches the end of the line. There, we will notice that the mBot doesn't stop, since we didn't include such behaviour in the program. Instead it will make erratic movements that might even get it to make a U-turn, eventually, due to difference in traction between the wheels.

We can actually improve the program even further by using the proximity sensor so that the robot can detect by itself the end of the line, by sensing the obstacle we have placed there. And then even make a U-turn to get back to where it started. We will handle all this in the next chapter.

And of course, let's remember to save the project, before anything else.

### Questions

Question 5.27.1: What will happen when the mBot reaches the end of the line, executing the program in image 5.27.2?

A. It will stop moving.

B. It will perform a U-turn by executing the corresponding U-turn block.

C. It might perform a U-turn due to difference in traction between the wheels.

D. It will go on eventually crashing on some obstacle found in the way.
