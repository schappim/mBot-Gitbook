## Chapter 1: the mBot parts

---

In this chapter, you will learn about:

* The parts that make up the mBot that are contained in the box
* How to assemble the mBot
* Other parts that you can use to extend the functionality of your mBot
* The software options that you have for programming your mBot



The mBot doesn't come assembled. It comes in a box like this with all the parts inside. You've got to put them together, and this is a process that takes about 15, maybe 20 minutes. It's not that complicated process, so young children should also be able to handle the assembly process with a bit of supervision because there are a few small parts like rivets and screws. I'm going to open up the box and have a look at the contents.

Open the box. At the top, you'll see the the mBlock micro-controller unit and the aluminum chassis. The mBlock micro-controller unit is called "mCore". Inside, it contains an Arduino-compatible board, and has connectors for the various components like sensors, and motors. Take out the mCore and have a look around this device. Notice the various connectors with their markings. Find two connected marked M1 and M2? these are the motor connectors. There's also switches and buttons, and connectors for different kinds of batteries. Don't worry about any of this for now, you will learn about all of that very soon.

The chassis is what brings all the compoents together. Using screws, you can attach the mCore controller, the motors, sensors and batteries to the chassis. It's like a skeleton!

We've got the connector for the Arduino cable to the computer for the programming part, and there's a reset button in here as well. I'm going to open up this unit a bit later, so that we can also connect the radio component. In our case, we'll be using the Bluetooth version of the mBot. We'll open up this case and plug in the Bluetooth module onto the \[unintelligible 00:01:46\] controller board.Then, we'll take that whole thing off. We've got the chassis. This is the chassis of the mBot. Nice aluminium chassis and well-made. Here, I've got the motors. I have a two-geared DC motors. We've got a manual with really nice blow-out instructions, easy to follow. I'll be using that during the assembly demonstration. Then we've got a printout for the line following experiment. You can use, but I've already made my own on the floor. I'll show you later, but this is something that you can use straight out of the box to get your robot to follow the line. The line-following program is one of the programs that are actually built in to the firmware of the mBot as it comes from the factory.You can start having a bit of time and experiment with the mBot we brought away out of the box. I'm going to keep these \[unintelligible 00:03:10\] as well. Then, we've got all the other bits and pieces of devices. This one here, actually open up these little envelopes, the \[unintelligible 00:03:22\] pouches. As I go through them, I'll explain what each one is. This one here, is the line-following module. It's got two sets of sensors.These are able to detect dark areas or light areas on a surface and then accordingly, can see if one is outside the dark area. The other one is inside the dark area, then information can be used to tell the mBot to shift towards the left in this case so that both sensors are in the dark area on the paper and so on. This is what the sensor does. Then, we've got the ultrasonic distance sensor. This distance sensor uses ultrasonic transmitter and receiver. It sends out an ultrasonic pulse, and then the device can measure the amount of time that it takes for the echo to come back.From this information, it can figure out how far away an object is in front of the sensor. We can use this device to create collision detection capability for the mBot which we'll be using in this course as well. Here, this is the communications module. In our case, it's the Bluetooth module. The mBot also comes with a radio frequency module as well, but we'll be using the Bluetooth module so that we can also use our mBot with devices such as the iPad or other mobile device like a mobile phone. We have a battery pack. This battery pack requires four AA batteries. It's defined, nothing fancy or they can power the mBot using this connector here, using a more powerful smaller and lighter lithium ion battery like this one.The batteries like this, can be connected to the secondary battery connector and provide more power at a smallest size. This is also more expensive, and the charging requirements of a battery like this a bit more involved. You need to have a specialized balanced charger to charge a batter like this instead of the simplicity of using simply AA batteries that you can charge with a cheap charger. In this course, I'll be using this battery pack mostly USB cable. I've got various bits and pieces like screws, spacers, bits of adhesive tape as well, and a couple of other things. I won't open this bag at the moment. These are screws for the wheels. Got the remote control which I can activate one of the resident programs that the mBot ships with.I'll explain more of about this after the mBot is assembled. I've got a very, very nice screw driver, I'll open that now. This screw driver has two ends. One is Phillips screw head, and then the other one is the hexagonal. They can use this same tool with different kinds of screws that we need in order to do the assembly. There's the screw driver. We've got connectors for the motors, two wheels with the wheel covers. These are small container for a small lithium ion battery. I won't be using this container in this course. With the unboxing and the quick description of the contents of the box, let's go ahead with the actual assembly process.
