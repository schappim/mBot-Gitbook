## Chapter 12: Programming the mBot on your computer using mBlock

---

### This chapter is a an introduction to a new section {#this-chapter-is-a-recap-of-what-you-have-learned-so-far}

There are no hands-on activities in this chapter.

---

It's time to get serious now.

In this section, you will learn about mBlock, the version of the software that you will use to create programs for your mBot on your computer, instead of a tablet.

The mBlock application is available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux computers. Most of the instructions and demonstrations in the chapters that follow will use descriptions and screenshots or illustrations from the Windows version of the application. If you are using Mac OS or Linux, know that everything will work for you exactly as it does on the Windows version, with the exception of the USB port names.

In the next chapter, you will start by installing mBlock on the computer. Then, you will spent a bit more time learning Scratch. And right after that you will compose and upload your first program to your mBot.

### Note:

If you are already familiar with Scratch, you may want to skip Chapter 14 \("A quick look at Scratch"\), and go directly to Chapter 15.
