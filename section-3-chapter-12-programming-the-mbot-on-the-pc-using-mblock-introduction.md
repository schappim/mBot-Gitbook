## Chapter 12: Programming the mBot on the PC using mBlock

---

The t

It's time to get serious now.

In this section, you will learn about mBlock, the PC version of the software that we use to program the mBot.

mBlock is available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux computers. Most of the instructions and demonstrations in the chapters that follow will use descriptions and screenshots or illustrations from the Windows version of the application. If you are using Mac OS or Linux, know that everything will work for you exactly as they do on the Windows version, with the exception of the USB port names.

You will start in the next chapter by installing mBlock on your computer. Then, you will continue by taking a lengthily look at Scratch; the graphical programming language. Soon later, you will upload your first program to the mBot and learn how to control the motors.

If you are already familiar with Scratch, you may want to skip Chapter 14, and go directly to Chapter 15 once you install mBlock on your computer.
