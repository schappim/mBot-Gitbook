Sometimes, students become confused when they try to use their mBot with the iPad or with a tablet, after they've programmed it on their computer.

They might also become frustrated because, after programming the mBot on the computer, they cannot take it back to the factory settings, so that they can use the infrared remote controller or run one of the default programs that you played with in Chapter 5.

In this last section of the course you will learn how to restore these functionalities, and in particular:

1. How to restore the firmware \(program\) that make it possible to connect your mBot to your tablet.
2. How to restore the default program that is stored on your mBot when it comes new from the factory.

Go right ahead to the next chapter!
