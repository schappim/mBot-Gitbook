## Chapter 13: Install mBlock on your computer

---

**In this chapter you will learn about:**

* How to download mBlock for Windows, Mac and Linux
* How to install mBlock on your computer
* How to start mBlock for the first time

---

**This chapter contains hand-on activities.**

You will not need any tools.

You will need a computer, access to the Internet, and the ability to install new software. If the computer that you are using is part of a lab in your school and are not able to install software on it, ask the lab administrator for assistance with this activity.

Get mBlock from [http://www.mblock.cc/download](http://www.mblock.cc/download)

---

The program that you will use from this point onwards for programming your mBot is called mBlock. This is free software that you can download for Windows, Mac OS or Linux computers from www.mblock.cc/download.

Go there now. Notice that there are three versions of the software. One for Windows, one for Mac OS and one for Linu. Click on the one that matches your computer's operating system and start the download process. The software is fairly large so the download process will take some time to complete.![](/assets/2017-03-22_14-40-54.png)\[Image 3.13.1: Download mBlock from www.mblock.cc/download\]

Once the download completes, install it on your computer as you do with any other software.

When you complete the installation, start mBlock by double-clicking on its icon! Whether you are using a Windows, Mac or Linux computer, mBlock will look the same.![](/assets/2017-03-22_14-59-14.png)\[Image 3.13.2: Starting the mBlock application for the first time\]

When mBlock starts, it should look like the screenshot in Image 3.13.2. Let's have a quick look at the components that make up this view of mBlock. In the next chapter you will go deeper into mBlock and learn to use everything you see in Image 3.13.2.

**Item 1** is the stage. In the stage, any sprite you use, in this example it's a Panda, will move around as instructed by its program. In this area your program can also print out messages; it is a way for your program to "speak" to you. For example, if your program contains an instruction that causes the sprite to move 5 steps to the right, then in the playground the sprite will do just that. The stage can contain multiple sprites and other graphical elements that you interact with programmatically.

**Item 2** is where the sprite list appears. At the moment, there is only the Panda sprite. You can replace it with any other image you like, as long as you have a compatible image file. You can use a photo of yourself if you like! In the Sprite list area you can add, remove and edit sprites.

**Item 3** is the Blocks Palette. This is where any programming graphical block appear. In this view, you can see three tabs, Scripts, Costumes and Sounds, that give you access to different functions. We will be using blocks in the Scripts tab. In the Scripts tab, you can see categories of blocks, like Motion, Looks, Sound etc. You will learn about many of these blocks in the next chapter.

In the Blocks Palette, the Costumes tab gives you access to the sprite editor. You can use the editor to change how a sprite looks, or even to create new sprites. And in the Sounds tab, you can design sounds and assign them to sprite activities. For example, you can draw a sprite that looks like a robot in the Costumes tab, and then use the Sound editor to create appropriate sounds so that when your robot moves it sounds like one of the Transformer robots walking.

**Item 4** is the scripts area. This is where you will start assembling your programs in the next chapter. You do that by dragging blocks from the blocks palette into the scripts area, and connecting them with other blocks.

### Did you know?

Because the mBot is based on the Arduino electronics board, it is common to use the term "sketch" in reference to a program.

A sketch is a program that we write for the purpose of testing an idea. In most cases, we will change this program in order to make it better or to get it to do something else, as new ideas come. So, a sketch is a temporary and always changing program.

In this book we do the same. We may use the term "sketch" or "program", meaning the same thing.

Great work! Now that you have installed mBlock, started it for the first time, and are familiar with its components, go on to the next chapter where you will learn about the most important programming blocks and create your first programs.
