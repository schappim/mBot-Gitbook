## Chapter 13: Install mBlock on your computer

---

In this chapter you will learn about:

* How to download mBlock
* How to install mBlock on your computer
* How to start mBlock for the first time

---

The program that you will use from this point onwards for programming your mBot is called mBlock. This is free software that you can download for Windows, Mac OS or Linux computer from www.mblock.cc/download.

Go there now and start the download process for your computer and operating system.![](/assets/2017-03-22_14-40-54.png)\[Image 3.13.1: Download mBlock from www.mblock.cc/download\]

Once the download completes, install it on your computer as you do with any other software. 

  
When you complete the installation, start mBlock! Whether you are using a Windows, Mac or Linux computer, mBlock will look the same.![](/assets/2017-03-22_14-59-14.png)\[Image 3.13.2: Starting the mBlock application for the first time\]

When mBlock starts, it should like like the screenshot in Image 3.13.2. Let's have a quick look at the components that make up this view of mBlock. In the next chapter you will go deeper into mBlock and learn to use everything you see in Image 3.13.2.

Item 1 is the stage. In the stage, any sprite you use, in this example it's a Panda, will move around as instructed by its program. In this area your program can also print out messages; it is a way for your program to "speak" to you. For example, if your program contains an instruction that causes the sprite to move 5 steps to the right, then in the playground the sprite will do just that. The stage can contain multiple sprites and other graphical elements that you interact with programmatically.

Item 2 is where the sprite list appears. At the moment, there is only the Panda sprite. You can replace it with any other image you like, as long as you have a compatible image file. You can use a photo of yourself if you like! In the Sprite list area you can add, remove and edit sprites.

Item 3 is the Blocks Palette. This is where any programming graphical block appear. In this view, you can see three tabs, Scripts, Costumes and Sounds, that give you access to different functions. We will be using blocks in the Scripts tab. In the Scripts tab, you can see categories of blocks, like Motion, Looks, Sound etc. You will learn about many of these blocks in the next chapter. 

In the Blocks Palette, the Costumes tab gives you access to the sprite editor. You can use the editor to change how a sprite looks, or even to create new sprites. And in the Sounds tab, you can design sounds and assign them to sprite activities. For example, you can draw a sprite that looks like a robot in the Costumes tab, and then use the Sound editor to create appropriate sounds so that when your robot moves it sounds like one of the Transformer robots walking.

Item 4 is the scripts area. This is where you will start assembling your programs in the next chapter. You do that by dragging blocks from the blocks palette into the scripts area, and connecting them with other blocks.

Arduino programs are referred to as 'sketches' just to amplify the prototyping nature of the platform. The fact that every program that you create is just a newer version of an older program, like an updated version of an older program, and we treat it as a sketch that very soon will be replaced by a newer version.  


Great work! Now that you are familiar with mBlock, go on to the next chapter where you will learn about the most important programming blocks and create your first programs.
