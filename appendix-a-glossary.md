## Glossary

**3-axis gyroscope:**A sensor that can detect change in orientation, like when it is turned over.

**Arduino board:**Computer hardware, in the form of a board, which contains a microcontroller that can be programmed to use sensors and other hardware connected to the board. _Synonyms: Arduino UNO board_

**ATmega328/P:**The specific type of microcontroller found on the mCore board, in the mBot. _See: mCore, microcontroller_

**attribute:**Often a function, in a program, needs input. That input is supplied to the function by the main program, while calling the function, and it is called “attribute”. A function can have more than one attributes. _See: function_

**Bluetooth:**A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances that is also used by the mBot to communicate with a mobile device, like a tablet.

**buzzer:**An output component, found on the mBot, that can be programmed to produce basic music tones in the form of beeps.

**code: **_See: program_

**COM port:**A virtual port that represents the USB connection and can be set in some applications, in order to make it possible to upload a program to the Arduino board. _See: Arduino board, program, USB_

**compiler:**The programs we compose for the mBot are good for the mBot user, to read and edit, but cannot be used as such by the mBot itself because the mBot can only execute instructions in “binary” and not graphical instruction blocks, Arduino code etc. There is a program that translates the “source code” into binary, suitable for direct execution by the mBot, called compiler. _See: binary, instruction blocks, program, source code_

**connector:**A small socket on the mBot, where various modules can be plugged. _See: module_

**control block:**An instruction block that can affect the flow of the execution of a program, or in other words: the order of execution of the blocks. It can be either a loop block or a decision \(if\) block. _See: instruction block, program_

**DC motor:**A small machine that coverts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy making the wheels of the mBot spin. DC stands for Direct Current.

**distance module:**A module, found on the mBot, that can sense the distance to an object in front of it. It makes use of two infrared sensors, very much like a radar. _See: infrared sensors_

**drag & drop:**The process, applied with graphical interfaces, where the user picks an element found on the screen andmoves it to a new position.

**firmware:**the software originally loaded to the mBot by the factory. It can be replaced by user made software and it can be restored, if needed.

**function:**A smaller part of a program, placed outside the main program, that can be seen as an autonomous entity performing a specific action. Functions can be called by the main program to execute their functionality. Functions can take input values, called attributes. See: attribute, program

**infrared sensors:**The infrared transmitter and infrared receiver found on the distance module. See: distance module, infrared receiver, infrared transmitter

**infrared receiver:**A sensor, found on the distance module, that receives the echo of an ultrasonic sound emitted by the infrared transmitter. See: distance module, infrared transmitter

**infrared transmitter:**A sensor, found on the distance module, that emits an ultrasonic sound that is meant to bounce off some object, in front of it, so that the infrared receiver can pick the echo and the mBot can use the delay of the echo to calculate the distance to that object.See: distance module, infrared receiver

**initialization:**The assignment of an original value to a variable.

**instruction block:**A graphical block representing an action, a value, a condition etc. that can be used in a Scratch program. In a way, instruction blocks are the building blocks of mBot programs. See: program, Scratch

**LED:**A Light-Emitting Diode \(and hence the acronym LED\) that emits light when activated, functioning like a little lamp.

**light sensor:**A sensor found on the mBot that detects the intensity of light, in other words, the darkness or brightness around it.

**line-follower module:**A module found on the mBot that contains two sensors and evaluates the position of the mBot in relation to a dark line drawn on a lighter background.

**LiPo battery:**A rechargeable type of battery that is widely used in modern technology.

**loop:**A repeating process, in a program, that will execute a group of instruction blocks over and over again. Usually, a loop evaluates a condition before each execution, nevertheless, there can be unconditioned loops, as well, than will repeat, theoretically, forever. Loops are considered to be control blocks. See: control block, instruction block, program

**MakeBlock:**An application that makes it easy to program the mBot, very suitable for kids and inexperienced users. See: program

**mBlockly:**An application for mobile devices, like tablets, that allows programming the mBot, by using Scratch instruction blocks. See: Scratch, instruction blogs

**mBot:**An application, designed as a game, that makes it easy to program the mBot.

**mCore:**The main control board of the mBot, which consists of a microcontroller, connectors, LEDs, a buzzer and other components. It is based on the Arduino board and it can be seen as the backbone of the mBot. See: microcontroller, connector, LED, buzzer

**microcontroller:**A programmable chip that can execute instructions. A microcontroller can be seen as the brain of a computer or some other programmable device, like the mBot. See: ATmega328/P

**module:**A small hardware device that adds functionality to the mBot.

**Port:**See: COM port

**program:**A set of instructions that can encode behaviour for the mBot. Synonyms: code, sketch

**Range finder moduleßthis term must be replaced in the book by “distance module”**

**RGB:**A system for representing an extensive array of colours just by adding together values for red \(R\), green \(G\) and blue \(B\). Each of these three values must be within the range of 0 to 255.

**sensor:**a hardware device that can detect somestimulus in the environment\(like sound, light, moisture etc.\) and then return a reading that can be used by the mBot.

**sketch:**See: program

**Skratch:**A programming language that can be used to create programs by putting graphical instruction blocks together. Skratch is broadly used to create stories, games and animation, mainly for educational purposes. It can be also used to program the mBot. See: instruction block, program

**source code:**The program in the form that it is composed by the programmer. A program made of instruction blocks is considered to be source code. The source program can be compiled by a compiler, in order to produce an executable program, in binary. See: binary, compiler, instruction block, program

**sprite:**A game object \(like a fighter, an animal, a spacecraft etc.\) that can perform actions.

**ultrasonic module/sensor:**See: distance module

**ultrasonic sensor gaugeßthis term must be replaced in the book by “distance module”**

**upload:**The action of transferring data from a workstation \(a computer, a tablet etc.\) to a distant device.

**USB:**An industry standard for cable connection. It is the standard connection we use to upload programs to the mBot. See: program, upload

**variable:**A small storage space in the computer memory, meant to hold data \(like numbers, text etc.\), that can be used within a program and can be referred to by some name.
