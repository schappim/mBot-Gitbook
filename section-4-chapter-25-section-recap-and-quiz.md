## Chapter 24: Recapping Section 4

---

### This chapter is a recap of what you have learned so far

In this chapter you will not learn anything new, but you will recapture on what you learned so far in Section 4.

There are no hands-on activities in this chapter.

In this section you had a first serious look at the ultrasonic sensor.

You learned:

* the principle of operation of the ultrasonic sensor
* how to program the ultrasonic sensor
* how to make the buzzer play a tone.
* how to use the "for" loop to execute a set of blocks repeatedly
* how to execute code conditionally using the "if" and "if...else" control structures.
* how to save a program to your computer,
* how to load it to mBlock, when needed.

You now know almost everything you need in order to create the line following program for your mBot. In the next section, you will learn about the line sensor, the sensor that is at the center of the line following program. Once that is done, you can proceed to actually compose the line follower program.

When you are ready, continue with the next chapter to get started!
