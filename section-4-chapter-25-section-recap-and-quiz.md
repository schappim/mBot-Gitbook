## Chapter 24: Recapping

---

In this section we had a first serious look at the ultrasonic sensor, how it behaves and how to program it. We also saw how to make the buzzer bip.

We also saw how to execute a set of blocks repeatedly, using a "for loop" and we learned how to take decisions using the "if" and "if...else" control structures.

Finally, we learned how to save a program and how to load it again, when needed.
