You learned:

* the principle of operation of the ultrasonic sensor
* how to program the ultrasonic sensor
* how to make the buzzer play a tone.
* how to use the "for" loop to execute a set of blocks repeatedly
* how to execute code conditionally using the "if" and "if...else" control structures.
* how to save a program to your computer,
* how to load it to mBlock, when needed.

You now know everything you need in order to continue with composing a program that will make your mBot to follow a black line on the floor. When you are ready, continue with the next chapter to get started!
