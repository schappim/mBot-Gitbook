## Chapter 18: Recapping

---

In this chapter, we saw how to create a Scratch program, with mBlock, how to connect to a COM port, how to upload the program to the Arduino board, inside the mBot, and how to have it run. We had the chance to compare between Scratch and Arduino text code. We saw how to use the move instruction block to move the mBot forwards, backwards and turn either left or right.

We made acquaintance with the concept of variables and saw how to set up a simple arithmetic operation.

At this point we are starting to get a good understanding of how movement can be achieved with the mBot. This is something but we need more. In the next part of this crash course we are going to handle more important programming concepts like the loop and the if.
