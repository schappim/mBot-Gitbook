## Chapter 18: Recapping Section 3

---

### This chapter is a recap of what you have learned so far

In this chapter you will not learn anything new, but you will recapture on what you learned so far in Section 2.

There are no hands-on activities in this chapter.

In this chapter, you learned about:

* how to create a Scratch program in mBlock, 
* how to connect your mBot to your computer, 
* how to upload the program to your mBot, 
* and how to execute the program,
* the relation between Scratch blocks and Arduino text code,
* how to use the "move" instruction block to move the mBot forwards, backwards and have it turn left or right,
* about variables and used them in a simple arithmetic operation.

At this point you are starting to gain an understanding of how you can program your mBot to use its motors so that it can move around. 

This is a great start, but there's much more to do!

In the next part of this course you are going to handle more advanced programming concepts like the loop and the "if else" structure.
