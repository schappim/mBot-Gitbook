## Chapter 18: Recapping

---

In this chapter, you learned how to create a Scratch program in mBlock, how to connect your mBot to your computer, how to upload the program to your mBot, and how to execute the program. 

You learned about the relation between Scratch blocks and Arduino text code. 

You learned how to use the "move" instruction block to move the mBot forwards, backwards and have it turn left or right.

You learned about variables and used them in a simple arithmetic operation.

At this point you are starting to form an understanding of how you can program your mBot to move around. This is a great start, but there's much more to do!.

In the next part of this course you are going to handle more important programming concepts like the loop and the "if else" structure.
