## Chapter 1: the mBot parts

---

In this chapter, you will learn about:

* The parts that make up the mBot that are contained in the box
* How to assemble the mBot
* Other parts that you can use to extend the functionality of your mBot
* The software options that you have for programming your mBot

---

The mBot doesn't come assembled. It comes in a box like this with all the parts inside. You've got to put them together, and this is a process that takes about 15, maybe 20 minutes. It's not that complicated process, so young children should also be able to handle the assembly process with a bit of supervision because there are a few small parts like rivets and screws. I'm going to open up the box and have a look at the contents.

\[Image 1: the mBot box\]

Open the box. At the top, you'll see the the mBlock **micro-controller** unit and the aluminum chassis. The mBlock micro-controller unit is called "mCore". Inside, it contains an **Arduino**-compatible board, and has connectors for the various components like **sensors**, and **motors**. Take out the mCore and have a look around this device. Notice the various connectors with their markings. Find two connected marked M1 and M2? these are the motor connectors. There's also **switches** and **buttons**, and connectors for different kinds of batteries. Don't worry about any of this for now, you will learn about all of that very soon.

The chassis is what brings all the components together. Using screws, you can attach the mCore controller, the motors, sensors and batteries to the chassis. It's like the skeleton of your mBot!

\[Image 2: the mCore and the chassis\]

Take out the mCore and put it aside for now. Take the chassis out of the box and turn it around. You'll find a small box that contains the two motors that make the mBot move. These are **geared** **DC motors**. The gears are inside the yellow enclosure. Their job is to take the fast rotational movement of the motor, that has low **torque**, and convert it into slower rotational movement with higher torque. This way your mbot will be able to move without getting stack on the carpet or obstacles.

Next, you will find a printed manual with easy to follow instructions. Keep it handy to help you with the assembly process. There is also a large sheet of paper with a **line pattern **printed on it that you will use to test your mBot once you have it assembled. You can use that, but you can also make your own line pattern with a black marker, or on your printer. I've already made my own. I have included the basic segments at the end of this book so that you can design your own line. Out of the box, the mBot comes pre-programmed with the line following program. I will show you how to use it to get your mBot to follow any black line it once the assembly is finished.

\[Image 4: the mBot following a black line on the floor\]

Next in the box, there are a lot of small modules packages in plastic bags. Carefully get the modules out of their bags and place them on your table. Let's learn what each one is and what kind of functionality it provides.

### The line-following module

The line following module is used to detect a black line and provide information to the mBot based on which the mBot can determine its position, relative to the line.

\[Image 5: the line-following module\]

You can see the line-following module in Image 5. The front side includes the connector, and the back two line sensors. You can also see six holes that we'll use later to mount the module onto the mBot chassis.

Using the two line sensors the mBot will be able to detect dark or light areas on a surface. When you mount the module on the mBot, the two line sensor will be facing down. As the mBot moves, the sensors will constantly measure the amount of light that is reflected of the surface on which it is travelling. This information is used by the mBot to determine whether it is traveling on a black line, outside a black line, or at the edge of a black line.

If one sensor is over a light area and the other one is over the dark area, then information can be used to tell the mBot to shift towards the left in this case so that both sensors are in the dark area on the paper.

\[Image 6: Both line sensors are over white - LEDs are lit\]

In Image 6, the line module is over the white part of the paper. You can see that both module indicator LEDs are lit. The mBot know that it is outside the line. We can program it so that it tries to find the line.

\[Image 7: Both line sensors are over black - LEDs are not lit\]

In Image 7, the line module is over the black part of the paper. You can see that both module indicator LEDs are not lit. The mBot know that it is inside the line. We can program it so that it continues to travel on the line.

![](/assets/one on white 2.JPG)

\[Image 8: One line sensors is over white, and one is over black\]

In Image 8, the module's first sensor is over the black line while the second sensor is outside the line. Notice that indicator LED 2 is lit, while LED 1 is not lit. This tells the mBot that it is about to loose the line. To keep the mBot on the line, we can program it so that when this condition appears, the mBot takes a slight turn to the left, so that both sensor are over the black line.

You will learn how to do all this later in this book. For now, let's have a look at the rest of the modules.

### The ultrasonic distance module

The distance sensor module uses and ultrasonic transmitter and receiver to measure the distance between it and an object infront of it. The transmitter sends out an ultrasonic pulse, and then the receiver detects the pusle after it is reflected on an object. By using the amount it takes for the pulse to travel from the transmitter to the object and then the receiver, the mBot can calculate the distance between the module and the object infront of it.

We can use this device to make it possible for the mBot to detect obstacles ahead of it, and to avoid them. You will learn how to use the ultrasonic distance sensor in this book as well.

### The Bluetooth module

Here, this is the communications module. In our case, it's the Bluetooth module. The mBot also comes with a radio frequency module as well, but we'll be using the Bluetooth module so that we can also use our mBot with devices such as the iPad or other mobile device like a mobile phone.

### The battery pack

We have a battery pack. This battery pack requires four AA batteries. It's defined, nothing fancy or they can power the mBot using this connector here, using a more powerful smaller and lighter lithium ion battery like this one.  
The batteries like this, can be connected to the secondary battery connector and provide more power at a smallest size. This is also more expensive, and the charging requirements of a battery like this a bit more involved. You need to have a specialized balanced charger to charge a batter like this instead of the simplicity of using simply AA batteries that you can charge with a cheap charger. In this course, I'll be using this battery pack mostly USB cable.

### Screws, nuts, spacers, adhesive tape, wheels

I've got various bits and pieces like screws, spacers, bits of adhesive tape as well, and a couple of other things. I won't open this bag at the moment. These are screws for the wheels. Got the remote control which I can activate one of the resident programs that the mBot ships with.

### Screwdriver

I'll explain more of about this after the mBot is assembled. I've got a very, very nice screw driver, I'll open that now. This screw driver has two ends. One is Phillips screw head, and then the other one is the hexagonal. They can use this same tool with different kinds of screws that we need in order to do the assembly. There's the screw driver. We've got connectors for the motors, two wheels with the wheel covers. These are small container for a small lithium ion battery. I won't be using this container in this course. With the unboxing and the quick description of the contents of the box, let's go ahead with the actual assembly process.
