## Chapter 1: the mBot parts

---

In this chapter, you will learn about:

* The parts that make up the mBot that are contained in the box
* How to assemble the mBot
* Other parts that you can use to extend the functionality of your mBot
* The software options that you have for programming your mBot

---

The mBot doesn't come assembled. It comes in a box like this with all the parts inside. You've got to put them together, and this is a process that takes about 15, maybe 20 minutes. It's not that complicated process, so young children should also be able to handle the assembly process with a bit of supervision because there are a few small parts like rivets and screws. I'm going to open up the box and have a look at the contents.

\[Image 1: the mBot box\]

Open the box. At the top, you'll see the the mBlock **micro-controller** unit and the aluminum chassis. The mBlock micro-controller unit is called "mCore". Inside, it contains an **Arduino**-compatible board, and has connectors for the various components like **sensors**, and **motors**. Take out the mCore and have a look around this device. Notice the various connectors with their markings. Find two connected marked M1 and M2? these are the motor connectors. There's also **switches** and **buttons**, and connectors for different kinds of batteries. Don't worry about any of this for now, you will learn about all of that very soon.

The chassis is what brings all the components together. Using screws, you can attach the mCore controller, the motors, sensors and batteries to the chassis. It's like the skeleton of your mBot!

\[Image 2: the mCore and the chassis\]

Take out the mCore and put it aside for now. Take the chassis out of the box and turn it around. You'll find a small box that contains the two motors that make the mBot move. These are **geared** **DC motors**. The gears are inside the yellow enclosure. Their job is to take the fast rotational movement of the motor, that has low **torque**, and convert it into slower rotational movement with higher torque. This way your mbot will be able to move without getting stack on the carpet or obstacles.

\[Image 3: the two geared DC motors\]

Next, you will find a printed manual with easy to follow instructions. Keep it handy to help you with the assembly process. There is also a large sheet of paper with a **line pattern **printed on it that you will use to test your mBot once you have it assembled. You can use that, but you can also make your own line pattern with a black marker, or on your printer. I've already made my own. I have included the basic segments at the end of this book so that you can design your own line. Out of the box, the mBot comes pre-programmed with the line following program. I will show you how to use it to get your mBot to follow any black line it once the assembly is finished.

![](/assets/line follower demo 601.JPG)

\[Image 4: the mBot following a black line on the floor\]

Next in the box, there are a lot of small modules packages in plastic bags. Carefully get the modules out of their bags and place them on your table. Let's learn what each one is and what kind of functionality it provides.

### The line-following module

The line following module is used to detect a black line and provide information to the mBot based on which the mBot can determine its position, relative to the line.

![](/assets/line module.png)

\[Image 5: the line-following module\]

You can see the line-following module in Image 5. The front side includes the connector, and the back two line sensors. You can also see six holes that we'll use later to mount the module onto the mBot chassis.

Using the two line sensors the mBot will be able to detect dark or light areas on a surface. When you mount the module on the mBot, the two line sensor will be facing down. As the mBot moves, the sensors will constantly measure the amount of light that is reflected of the surface on which it is travelling. This information is used by the mBot to determine whether it is traveling on a black line, outside a black line, or at the edge of a black line.

If one sensor is over a light area and the other one is over the dark area, then information can be used to tell the mBot to shift towards the left in this case so that both sensors are in the dark area on the paper.

![](/assets/both on white.JPG)

\[Image 6: Both line sensors are over white - LEDs are lit\]

In Image 6, the line module is over the white part of the paper. You can see that both module indicator LEDs are lit. The mBot know that it is outside the line. We can program it so that it tries to find the line.

![](/assets/both on black.JPG)

\[Image 7: Both line sensors are over black - LEDs are not lit\]

In Image 7, the line module is over the black part of the paper. You can see that both module indicator LEDs are not lit. The mBot know that it is inside the line. We can program it so that it continues to travel on the line.

![](/assets/one on white 2.JPG)

\[Image 8: One line sensors is over white, and one is over black\]

In Image 8, the module's first sensor is over the black line while the second sensor is outside the line. Notice that indicator LED 2 is lit, while LED 1 is not lit. This tells the mBot that it is about to loose the line. To keep the mBot on the line, we can program it so that when this condition appears, the mBot takes a slight turn to the left, so that both sensor are over the black line.

You will learn how to do all this later in this book. For now, let's have a look at the rest of the modules.

### The ultrasonic distance module

The distance sensor module uses and ultrasonic transmitter and receiver to measure the distance between it and an object infront of it. The transmitter sends out an ultrasonic pulse, and then the receiver detects the pusle after it is reflected on an object. From the amount of time it takes for the pulse to travel from the transmitter to the object and then to the receiver, the mBot can calculate the distance between the module and the object infront of it.![](/assets/ultrasonic distance sensor 600.JPG)

\[Image 9: The ultrasonic distance module contains an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver\]

We can use this device to make it possible for the mBot to detect obstacles ahead of it, and to avoid them. You will learn how to use the ultrasonic distance sensor in this book as well.

### The Bluetooth module

This is the communications module. More specific, it's a wireless Bluetooth module. Using the Bluetooth module, you will be able to use your mBot with your computer, an iPad or Android device,  or a smartphone.

![](/assets/bluetooth front 600.JPG)

\[Image 10: the wireless Bluetooth module\]

### The battery pack

To power the mBot, you have a couple of battery options. The simplest option is to use the supplied battery pack that can hold 4 AA batteries. I recommend Alkaline batteries if you want your mBot to operate for longer, or rechargable ones if you prefer not to have to replace the batteries with fresh ones constantly.

The AA battery pack has a lead with a barrel connector that plugs into the battery socket at the rear of the mCore contoroller.

![](/assets/battery pack 600.JPG)

\[Image 11: the 4xAA battery pack installed on the mBot chassis\]

You do have a second power option. You can use a Lithium Polymer Ion battery \(LiPo\). These batteries are smaller, lighter, and contain more energy that AA Alkaline batteries. But, they are a bit more expensive, require a special charger, and if not handled carefully that can cause small flame-ups and burn in flames. For this reason, I don't recommend that you use this option unless you have experience with them, or are supervised by someone that does.

Your mBot can also get power from the USB cable, connected to your computer. You will use this option while your mBot is tethered to your computer for programming.

### Screws, nuts, spacers, adhesive tape, wheels, cables

The box also contains various other parts, like screws, spacers, and adhesive tape. Keep those items in their plastic bags for now so that you don't loose them. You will need them all for the assembly process later.

![](/assets/screws.JPG)

\[Image 12: screws with hexagonal head - don't loose them!\]

There are also two plastic wheels with their tiny screws, and the remote control. The remote control device uses an infrared transmitter to send signals to an infrared receiver that is on the mCore. It works in the same way that the TV remote control does. With the remote control, you can start one of the build-in programs on the mBot, or control its movement. You can also program the mbot to react to any of the keys being pressed.

![](/assets/remote control.JPG)

\[Image 13: the infrared remote control has keys that can be programmed\]

### Screwdriver

The kit also contains a very handy scredriver. This screw driver has a bit with two ends. At the one end you will find a Phillips screw head, and then the other one is the hexagonal. Each end is appropriate for one of the types of screws that you will use later during the assembly.
