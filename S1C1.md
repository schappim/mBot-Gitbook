## Chapter 1: the mBot parts

---

In this chapter, you will learn about:

* The parts that make up the mBot that are contained in the box
* How to assemble the mBot
* Other parts that you can use to extend the functionality of your mBot
* The software options that you have for programming your mBot

---

The mBot doesn't come assembled. It comes in a box like this with all the parts inside. You've got to put them together, and this is a process that takes about 15, maybe 20 minutes. It's not that complicated process, so young children should also be able to handle the assembly process with a bit of supervision because there are a few small parts like rivets and screws. I'm going to open up the box and have a look at the contents.

Open the box. At the top, you'll see the the mBlock **micro-controller** unit and the aluminum chassis. The mBlock micro-controller unit is called "mCore". Inside, it contains an **Arduino**-compatible board, and has connectors for the various components like **sensors**, and **motors**. Take out the mCore and have a look around this device. Notice the various connectors with their markings. Find two connected marked M1 and M2? these are the motor connectors. There's also **switches** and **buttons**, and connectors for different kinds of batteries. Don't worry about any of this for now, you will learn about all of that very soon.

The chassis is what brings all the components together. Using screws, you can attach the mCore controller, the motors, sensors and batteries to the chassis. It's like the skeleton of your mBot!

Take out the mCore and put it aside for now. Take the chassis out of the box and turn it around. You'll find a small box that contains the two motors that make the mBot move. These are geared **DC motors**. The gears are inside the yellow enclosure. Their job is to take the fast rotational movement of the motor, that has low **torque**, and convert it into slower rotational movement with higher torque. This way your mbot will be able to move without getting stack on the carpet or obstacles.

Next, you will find a manual with easy to follow instructions. Keep it handy to help you with the assembly process. There is also a large sheet of paper with a line pattern that you will use to test your robot once you have it assembled. You can use that, but you can also make your own line pattern with a marker, or on your printer. I've already made my own on the floor. I have included the basic segments at the end of this book so that you can assemble then in any way you like. Out of the box, the mBot comes pre-programmed with the line following program. I will show you how to start it once the assembly is finished.

CONTINUE ---&gt;  Then, we've got all the other bits and pieces of devices. This one here, actually open up these little envelopes, the \[unintelligible 00:03:22\] pouches. As I go through them, I'll explain what each one is. This one here, is the line-following module. It's got two sets of sensors.  
These are able to detect dark areas or light areas on a surface and then accordingly, can see if one is outside the dark area. The other one is inside the dark area, then information can be used to tell the mBot to shift towards the left in this case so that both sensors are in the dark area on the paper and so on. This is what the sensor does. Then, we've got the ultrasonic distance sensor. This distance sensor uses ultrasonic transmitter and receiver. It sends out an ultrasonic pulse, and then the device can measure the amount of time that it takes for the echo to come back.  
From this information, it can figure out how far away an object is in front of the sensor. We can use this device to create collision detection capability for the mBot which we'll be using in this course as well. Here, this is the communications module. In our case, it's the Bluetooth module. The mBot also comes with a radio frequency module as well, but we'll be using the Bluetooth module so that we can also use our mBot with devices such as the iPad or other mobile device like a mobile phone. We have a battery pack. This battery pack requires four AA batteries. It's defined, nothing fancy or they can power the mBot using this connector here, using a more powerful smaller and lighter lithium ion battery like this one.  
The batteries like this, can be connected to the secondary battery connector and provide more power at a smallest size. This is also more expensive, and the charging requirements of a battery like this a bit more involved. You need to have a specialized balanced charger to charge a batter like this instead of the simplicity of using simply AA batteries that you can charge with a cheap charger. In this course, I'll be using this battery pack mostly USB cable. I've got various bits and pieces like screws, spacers, bits of adhesive tape as well, and a couple of other things. I won't open this bag at the moment. These are screws for the wheels. Got the remote control which I can activate one of the resident programs that the mBot ships with.  
I'll explain more of about this after the mBot is assembled. I've got a very, very nice screw driver, I'll open that now. This screw driver has two ends. One is Phillips screw head, and then the other one is the hexagonal. They can use this same tool with different kinds of screws that we need in order to do the assembly. There's the screw driver. We've got connectors for the motors, two wheels with the wheel covers. These are small container for a small lithium ion battery. I won't be using this container in this course. With the unboxing and the quick description of the contents of the box, let's go ahead with the actual assembly process.
