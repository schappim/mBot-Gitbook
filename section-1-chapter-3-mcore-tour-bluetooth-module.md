## Chapter 3: Assembly: mCore tour and bluetooth module

---

**In this chapter, you will learn about:**

* The different components on the mCore board
* How to connect the Bluetooth module

---

**This is a hand-on activity.**

No tools are necessary. You will need the mCore and the Bluetooth module.

---

In this chapter you will work with the mCore, the microcontroller module.

Remove the protective film from the bottom of the mCore as there is no need for it anymore. The first thing to do is to gently open up the case. Hold the top and bottom plastic cover in your hands, and carefully pull them away from each other. They should come off easily as there are no screws holding them in place.

Take a few minutes to become familiar with the parts that make up this module. Here they are \(use Image 1.3.1 as reference\):

### 1

The small square integrated circuit in the middle is the ATmega328/P microcontroller. This is the the brain of the mBot. Itâ€™s the same microcontroller that you find on the Arduino UNO.

### 2  

a. The infrared receiver 

b. The infrared transmitter.

With the infrared receiver, we are able to use the remote controller \(the one that comes with the mBot\) and get it to move in particular directions. We can program the mBot so that it performs a particular behaviour when a button of the remote controller is pressed. For example, we can program key "0" to play a tone, and button "1" to make the mBot spin. With the transmitter, on the other hand, we can get the mBot to transmit infrared signals to other mBots.

### 3

There is a buzzer, so that the mBot can make noises.

### 4 

There are two RGB-color LEDs, each capable of producing thousands of colours.

### 5

In between the RGB LEDs is a light sensor which is used by the mBot in order to figure out whether it is day or night, whether a light is turned on or off, or simply put, whether there is light or darkness.

### 6

There's a general purpose button that can be programmed to do things like making a noise, starting the motor etc.

### 7

There's a reset button that resets the the program on the mBot.

### 8

There are four numbered connectors \(one, two, three, and four\) where you can plug in the various modules. The range finder or the light follower sensor, for example, can connect to any one of those sockets.

### 9

These are the connectors where we plug the DC motors.

### 10

The on-off switch.

### 11

The LiPo battery connector.

### 12

The is a USB connector. You will use this connector to connect the mBot to your computer and upload a program. It is exactly the same connector that you find on an Arduino UNO. 

### 13

The connector for the communications module. The mBot operates with two different modules, one is just the radio frequency module and the other one is a Bluetooth module. In our case, we'll be using the Bluetooth module which is very easy to connect: Just align it, plug it in and you've got it connected.

---

**Attention:** One troublesome design issue that is the cause of many headaches is that you can actually plug the Bluetooth module in reverse. It will still fit in the socket just fine, and you will be able to attach the cover of the mCore just fine. It will connect but of course it is not going to work because it's plugged in the wrong way. I've seen this happening in large groups of people where mistakenly somebody will just plug the module, then put the cover back on, continue with the assembly of the mBot, and then half an hour later, the thing isn't working and that's because the module was plugged in the wrong way. So be very careful here.

---

Notice that the antenna design is printed very noticeable on both the the module and the mBot controller board. That's a hint that you can give your students that they have to align the printed shape of the antenna on the module with the one on the mBot controller board, and of course the pins should also match precisely.

In order to finish, put the cover back on, applying a little bit of pressure, so that the clips connect.
