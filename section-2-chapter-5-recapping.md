## Chapter 11: Recapping section 2

---

### This chapter is a recap of what you have learned so far

In this chapter you will not learn anything new, but you will recapture on what you learned so far in Section 2.

There are no hands-on activities in this chapter.

In this section you learned about the three applications that allow you to play and program your mBot using a tablet, wirelessly. 

The three applications that you are now familiar with are:

* Makeblock
* mBlockly
* mBlock for tablets

While these applications are are great way to get started with programming your mBot, you will quickly reach the limit of their capabilities. 

The programs that you write on these applications don't execute directly on to the mBot but rather on the tablet. The tablet is, in effect, remotely controlling your mBot, and this introduces a lot of computational overhead that makes programming inefficient.

If you want your mBot to be able to make quick decisions, like taking multiple readings from its sensors and then changing the speed of rotation of the motors to change direction to prevent it from bumping onto an obstacle, then you will need a better way to program it. The tablet apps will not be suitable.

In the next section, and in the remainder of this course, you will learn how to use the mBlock for Windows, Mac and Linux application which allows us to programm the mBot. 

You will use the same Scratch language that you played with on your tablet, but mBlock will first convert your program into the mBot's native language and then transfer \(upload\) this native program to the mBot.

This way, your program will run at its maximum speed. Your mBot will be able to do a lot more interesting things!
