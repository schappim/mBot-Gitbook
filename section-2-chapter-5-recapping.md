## Chapter 11: Recapping

The three applications handled:

* Makeblock
* mBlockly
* mBlock

are great to get started with. They’re not very efficient because the programs that you write don't execute directly on to the mBot but rather on the tablet which remotely controls the mBot, and the penalty therefore is efficiency.

~~**{Up to here by Dimitris}**~~

If your mBot needs to make quick decisions that involve perhaps taking readings from the sensors and then changing the speed of rotation of the motors to change direction, and if this needs to happen very quickly in order, for example, to not leave the line that the robot is following, then this is not going to be possible with one of those applications. It’s just they’re just too slow to be able to do something like that. But for many other things, these three applications are an excellent way to get started.

Having said all that, in the next section and in the remainder of this course, I will be showing you how to use the mBlock application which allows to control your mBot on your Windows or Macintosh computer. This works a lot like the Arduino, so the process there is that you write your program using the Scratch language and then that program is translated to native Arduino C code without you actually having to do anything, and then it gets uploaded on to your mBot.

What eventually you get on the mBot is Arduino code that runs at maximum speed so that you can control your mBot very efficiently, can get it to do things like that, follow a live that losing its way.

Let’s move on to the next lecture and check that out.
