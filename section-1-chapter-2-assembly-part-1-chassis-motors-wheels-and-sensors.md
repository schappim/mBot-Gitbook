For the assembly process I recommended that you put aside about 15, have to be 20 minutes. This is said earlier, small kids, say, seven years and older should be able to complete this process with a bit of supervision. There are a few small pieces that the supervisor needs to be mindful of. It need a bit of accurate manipulation.

Let's get started. The first thing to do is to begin with the chassis and connect the two-geared DC motors to the chassis. Notice that the chassis has a front, it's a smiley face. This is a front, and a back. I'm going to orient my chassis like this, and notice then that at the back I've got the two large holes from either side, and this is the way a DC motor shaft has to be inserted through like that.

\[Image 1.2.1: Attaching the motors to the chassis\]

Play around with the positioning of the motor. You want the white shaft to come out of the large whole, but then there's also a small indentation. This indentation here, that has to go through this smaller hole. That keeps the motor in place, like that. I should do that, you notice that, I'll use the motor to show this.

There are a couple of holes that go from one end of the motor casing to the other. This is where you'll insert the long screws through to attach the motor onto the chassis. These screws, let's see where are they? They are in here. We're going to open up the large pack. It's the small bits and pieces. Screws, spaces, then here are the long screws for the motors.

Okay, there we are. I'll grab two of those. I also need the nuts. This little bag here has the nuts to go with the screws. Make sure none of them are left in the bag. We're going to need every single one of them. Here's a nut, going to take the screw, and make sure that my motor is properly aligned so wide shaft from the motor and this little indentation onto fits on the chassis.

Then, I'll push the screw through the opening on the chassis. It might go all the way in. If you push it hard enough it will. Just make sure that the screw head is on the outside of the chassis because you need to be able to use your screw driver with it. Some people, by mistake, they put it on the other side, then of course, they can use the screw driver, and have to take it out.

All right, I will use a Philips screw head on my screw driver, and position the nut on the other side of the screw, and start turning the screw driver to secure the nut against the screw. Okay. Same thing with the second screw. Just push it through all the way. Here's the nut. Place the nut onto the screw and start turning the screw driver.

Now, this bit is kind of tricky and small kids will have trouble with, so keep an eye on the kids. You'll probably have a few accidents with the nuts, and roll off the table and onto the floor, and then you have to go hunting for these little bits. All right, other side now. Again, I find it much easier to start with a top screw because it's just easier to work with a nut on the other side.

Therefore, we have a bit a little easily secure the motor against the chassis and they will go for the harder bit, that's the screw on the bottom. Okay, so that's one. That's two. I've got my motors with the two screws and the two nuts secured against the chassis. These are not going anywhere, correct. Next, let's do the wheels.

We've got two wheels with plastic or rubber wheel covers. Let's assemble them. You can see that inside this plastic wheel, we've got a small groove in which the wheel can secure against. Gently slide one into the other. Okay, that's one. Do the same for the other wheel. There's the other. The bag that contains the screws that we want is this one here.

I can see that the screws here are the ones that got a pointy end, and they're quite thin. These are the ones that we want to use for our wheels.

Open this little bag, get the four screws out. Let's attach the first one. Notice that the wheel has got two sides. One is the one in which the screw is going to go like that. This one, of course, is on the outside. The other one has got an insert that fits with the shaft of the motor. Manipulate a little bit on to the motor until it slides in, and then secure the wheel onto the motor with the screw. Don't screw these too far and then apply too much force because these are just plastic bits. If you screw it too much, you're going to ruin the threads.

If you do that though, just remember that you've got another little bag with a spare parts for the motors.

These things here are the shaft of the motor, it's plastic. If you are having problems with the wheels not turning when the motor is turning, then mostly the shaft on the wheel has its teeth, so I should take that out of the bag to be able to get a view of this. What happens is that the teeth on the shaft, these teeth here are probably been grind down and therefore they are not connecting to the gears inside the yellow box. If this happens, you will have to open up this yellow box and replace this part.

Luckily enough, this part comes in a package with the mBot, so you can keep them as spares. Don't lose them. Keep them somewhere safe. It's a matter of time that this actually will happen. If you turn the wheels like this, one way when the motor is pushing them the other way, then you will eventually damage the gears. Not a huge deal since there are replacements around. You can also get replacements by ordering them.

So second wheel on. I use another screw with a pointy end, that in there, and tighten the screw without overdoing it. Use a thumb to keep the wheel stopped so that the wheel doesn't turn as you turn the screwdriver. If I don't get my thumb on the wheel, so I turn the screwdriver, they will all turn. Okay, done. This part is finished.

The next thing to do, is to attach the line from a module. To do that, I need my line from my module plus the module with the wheel. I've got a mini wheel here. I need to assemble one module on top of the other, and then secure them on to the chassis. So remember that right now, I'm looking at the bottom of the mBot and the line-following sensors need to point to the bottom.

I'm not going to plug that in like this, but like this. And notice that there are one, two, three pairs of holes here. You want to use the one in the middle. You don't want this bit to extend too far in front of it. You go for the middle. And then, you want to also attach the mini wheel module right on top of the line-following module like that facing backwards instead of forwards. Because if you do it like that, you will obstruct the sensors with a wheel. So we'll do it backwards like that.

Now, for this, we will need to use the short and thick screws. These screws here, they don't require a nut. They just screw it directly on to the chassis, because the chassis already has the threads on it. So going to take my assembly, put the screw in through it, and then attach it on to the chassis. Now, these are hexagon heads. So I need to flip my screwdriver so I can use a hexagon bit at the end.

All right, I'll start with the first screw. Here we go. It plugs right in, they're easy to screw in. With the first screw, don't tighten it too much. You need to be able to allow the module to give a little bit so that you can align it with the second hole. And they've got this second screw going in. Okay, now you can screw both screws in, tighten them in a little bit more. Done. Then, flip the mBot over and what we do next is to attach the range finder.

The range finder needs to point forwards, remember, back, forwards, you know which way is forwards because it's got this smiley face in front of it. So we want to attach the range finder in like that. Just put in the first screw, leave it a little loose, and insert the second screw. I'm not tightening the screws so that the range finder is nice and secure. Here we go, okay.

Next, let's attach the cables. I've got two cables here, one for each sensor. I get the first one, connect it to the line-following sensor, and I will pass that through the small hall on the chassis to go to through the top side of the chassis, where the microcontroller module eventually will be. We're going to push that there and then pull the cable out so that I expose the cable up the top. Then, plug the second cable to the range finder.
