## Chapter 2: Assembly

---

**In this chapter, you will learn about:**

* How to attach the two Direct Current \(DC\) motors to the mBot chassis
* How to attach the line follower module and the mini wheel module to the mBot chassis
* How to attach the range finder module to the mBot chassis

---

##### This is a hands-on activity.

You will need the screwdriver that comes with the mBot, and the various parts supplied in the kit.

For the assembly process I recommended that you put aside about 15 to 20 minutes. Because there are a few tiny parts involved, especially screws that need precision placement and should definately not be eaten, young children should be supervised.

The first thing to do is to begin with the chassis and attach the two-geared DC motors. Notice that the chassis is not symmetrical, it has a front and a back. The front is the side with the smiley face.

\[Image 1.2.1: The smiley face indicates the front of the chassis\]

Place the chassis on the table with the rear towards the left. Notice that close to the rear end of the chasis, as you look at it from the sides, are two large holes, one on each side. This is where the motor shaft must be placed.

\[Image 1.2.2: The shaft of the motor must be placed in the large hole in the rear of the mBot\]

Take one of the motors and position it so that its shaft goes through the large hole in the rear of the mBot. There is a small indentantion on the plastic case of the motors that goes through a smaller hole close to the shaft. Carefully align the motor case so that you can see two screw holes as you are looking down from the side of the chassis. Image 1.2.2 cam help you find the right posisioning of the motor.

Once the motor case snugs into place, take two long screws and their nuts and use them to secure the motors in place. I find it easier to start with the screw that is closer to the outside of the chassis because it is easier to reach. Once you tighten that screw, the motor will be safely attached to the chassis and it will be easier to tighten the second screw.

\[Image 1.2.3: Attaching the motors to the chassis\]

Be patient. Use the screwdriver to drive the screw in the channel of the motor case. Use your fingers to hold the nut in place while you turn the screw, and turn the screwdriver just enough to produce some tension, without damaging the threads.

\[Image 1.2.4: Attaching the motors to the chassis\]

Repeat this process for both motors.

Once you are finished with the motors, continue to work on the wheels. The kit contains two white plastic wheels with two black rubber wheel covers. Inside this rubber wheel cover, there is a small channel in which you need to insert the wheel. Gently push the wheel into the channel of the cover. Do the same for the second wheel.

\[Image 1.2.5: Assemble the wheels\]

One of the plastic bags contains two long screws that we need for securing the wheels against the motor shafts. Find the ones that are thin, long and have a pointy tip.

\[Image 1.2.6: Use two of these screws to secure the wheels against the motor shafts\]

Using the Philips screwhead, drive the screw into the shaft. Don't use too much force. All the components are plastic and especially the screw threads are easy to damage.![](/assets/IMG_9613.JPG)

\[Image 1.2.7: Attach the wheels to the motor shafts\]

If you do damage one of these parts remember that the kit comes with spares, and you can also order more from MakeBlock.

One more thing to remember is that inside the motor gear box are several plastic gears. Those can also be damaged during operation, or can wear off over time. If you are having problems with the wheels not turning when the motor is turning, the most likely cause is the the gears inside the gear box are damaged. If this happens, you can open up the yellow gear box and replace this part instead of buying a new motor. Replacement gears are included in the kit.

The next thing to do, is to attach the line follower module. This component is mounted at the front of the mBot, together with the front wheel module. First, find two hexagonal screws. Then, place the line module with the sensor pointing down at the front of the chassis. On top of the line module place the mini wheel module, with the wheel towards the back of the mBot. If you place the wheel pointing towards the front, you will block the line sensors.

So remember that right now, you should be looking at the bottom of the mBot and the line-following sensors need to point to the bottom.

Look at Images 1.2.8 and 1.2.9 to work out the placement of the line follower module and mini wheel module combo.

\[Image 1.2.9: Attach the wheels to the motor shafts, view 2\]

To secure the two modules against the chassis, use the short and thick screws. They screw directly on to the chassis, because the chassis holes already have the threads.

Now, its time to attach the range finder module.

The range finder needs to point forward, on the end of the mBot with the smiley face on it.

\[Image 1.2.10: Attach the rangefinder module to the front of the mBot\]

Place the range finder module at the front of the chassis and align it as I show in Image 1.2.10. Take one hex screw and use it to secure one side of the module. Don't tighten it too much; if you do it will be harder to adjust the other screw opening with the corresponding hole in the chassis. Insert the second screw, and once you are happy that the module is properly attach, tighten them slightly more.

Finally for this chapter, let's work on the cables. Under the mBot, there are two cables from the motors and one from the line follower module \(see Image 1.2.11\). You must pass those cables through an opening in the chassis to the top of the mBot so that later you can connect them to the mCore.

\[Image 1.2.11: Pass the cables from the motors and the line module to the top of the mBot\]

Turn the mBot over, and plug the second cable to the range finder. The assembly for this chapter is complete.

**Checklist**

Double-check that at this point, the following are completed:

\[ \] The two motors are properly attached to the chassis

\[ \] The wheels with their rubber covers are properly attached to the shaft of the motors.

\[ \] The front wheel and line follower assembly are properly attached to the front of the mBot chassis. The sensors of the line follower module should be looking downwards, and the wheel should be clear of the sensors. The screws are firm but not too hard inserted into the chassis.

\[ \] The range finder / distance sensor module is attached to the front of the chassis, right above the smiley face cutout.

\[ \] The cables for the line follower and range finder modules are connected to the modules

\[ \] The motor and line follower cables are passed through to the top of the chassis through the opening behind the range finder
