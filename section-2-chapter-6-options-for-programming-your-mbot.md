When it comes to programming the mbot, there are several options available and in this lecture, I would like to introduce them to you. The first one is the M-block application that runs on a PC that is Windows or Macintosh computer and M-block is actually the program that we will be using throughout this course to do the bulk of our programming.

So M-block is an application that uses blocks and then you use those blocks that represent programming components and programming structures to create a program that will then execute on the mbot. A lot more about these later. Now, you can also program your mbot on a mobile device, so Ios or Android tablets or smartphones can also be used to program the mbot.

Here you've got three different choices, each one app provides or gives emphasis in a particular aspect of programming. So the first one is Make-block. With Make-block, you can create custom dashboards for your mbot, so you can create a dashboard that includes for example a joystick and a reading of the data coming out of the distance sensor and that is displayed of course on the screen of your tablet. I will be spending a bit of time showing you how to use Make-block in a separate lecture coming up. That is Make-block.

The next one is and M-block. M-block is designed for really young kids that perhaps have never had any programming experience before. Having said that, just remember that almost everything that Make-block makes and the products that they produce as educational products are really for children and people who have never used a programming language before, they have never programmed anything and that is why there is a lot of emphasis in a graphical programming language instead of classic tech-based programming language.

But the M-block app for smart-phones and tablets has got this additional gamification aspect which makes programming look more like a game than programming itself. So it will guide you through certain steps of putting those blocks together and then give you rewards and points for doing so and I will demonstrate exactly how that works in the coming up lecture in this section.

Then finally we have M-blockly. Now M-blockly looks very very similar to M-block. M-block and M-blockly are basically the same thing, in that they provide you with a programming interface that allows you to use graphical components to put together a program, that is, whatever program you want to put in there. So think of M-blockly as the tablet version of M-block.

I am going to show you what all of these apps look like in the next lecture. So I am going to show you Make-block, I am going to show you M-block and M-blockly in the next lecture and give you some examples and demonstration on how to use them and also highlight some of the restrictions. And once we are done having a look and a tour of these three apps, then I will dedicate the rest of our time in this course playing around with M-block and building up our application using M-block.
