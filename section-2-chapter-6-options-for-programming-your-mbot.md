## Chapter 6: options for programming the mBot

---

In this chapter you will learn about:

* The available three applications with which you can program the mBot
* The basic characteristics of each application so that you can choose the most appropriate one for your objectives

---

**This is a reading activity.**

Please read this chapter carefully. It will provide information that you will need later in this book.

When it comes to programming the mBot, you have three tools that you can choose from:

* mBlock for Windows and PC
* Makeblock for tablets
* mBlock for tablets
* mBlockly for tablets

The first one, mBlock, is a full-fledged programming environment for the mBot, and the one that allows you to take advantage of all of the mBot's capabilities.

The other two, Makeblock and mBlock, are designed for Android and iOS tablets and meant to provide a gentle entry into the world of robotics.

Let's have a closer look at each one.

### mBlock

The first one, mBlock is an application that runs on a Windows or Macintosh computers. Like all mBot programming options, mBlock allows you to write programs using the popular graphical programming language Scratch. In Scratch, instead of writing a program using text commands, you arrange blocks on a canvas. Each block represents a programming function. By combining together the appropriate blocks, you can build programs, and then upload them to your mBot. You will learn a lot about Scratch and its blocks later in this book.

mBlock is the program we will be using in this book to write the line follower program. By the time you finish this project, you will be fluent at using it.

### Makeblock

Makeblock is designed for very young children or adults that have never programmed in the past. With Makeblock, you can start programming your mBot without doing any programming at all. You don't even have to use the Scratch graphical programming language; you can have a lot of fun and implement interesting behaviours by adding various components on the design canvas, using your iPad or Android tablet.

Makeblock is a great way to start playing with the mBot.![](/assets/Mbot - 0080 - Ipad 2 - demo of Makeblock mblockly mblock.MP4.mp4-00-02-57-013.png)\[Image 2.6.2: Makeblock, running on an iPad. It is a great way to access and use the mBot modules and motors\]

With Makeblock, as you will learn in Chapter 9, you can do a lot:  play music with the buzzer, visualise data from the distance sensor and the light sensor in a line graph, navigate the mBot with a joystick, or make a colourful display of colour using the two RGB LEDs.

### mBlock

The last application in this quick tour is mBlock. mBlock is an application that works on Android and iOS tablets. Confusinlgy, it has the name name as the application we will be using on Windows and Mac.

mBlock for Android and iOS is designed as a game. The game takes you through a series of stages, and in each stage you win by learning something new about mBot programming, and applying your new knowledge to win points. ![](/assets/Mbot - 0080 - Ipad 3 - demo of Makeblock mblockly mblock.MP4.mp4-00-09-17-025.png)\[Image 2.6.3: mBlock for tablets is a game. You win by learning how to program your mBot\]

### mBlockly

Finally, there is mBlockly. mBlockly for tablets is very similar to mBlock for Windows and Mac. They both provide you with a programming interface that allows you to use graphical components to put together a program. Both allow you to use Scratch, the graphical programming language, to compose a program. Think of mBlockly as the tablet version of mBlock.![](/assets/Mbot - 0080 - Ipad 3 - demo of Makeblock mblockly mblock.CONSTANT-00-02-36-638.png)\[Image 2.6.4: mBlockly is the tablet version of mBlock for Windows and Mac.

You will learn how to use these applications in the next three chapters. First, in the next chapter, you will learn about Makeblock, followed by mBlock and mBlockly. You will also learn about some of their limitations.
