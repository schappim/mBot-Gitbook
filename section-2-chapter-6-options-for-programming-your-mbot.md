## Chapter 6: options for programming the mBot

---

In this chapter you will learn about:

* The available three applications with which you can program the mBot
* The basic characteristics of each application so that you can choose the most appropriate one for your objectives

**This is a reading activity.**

Please read this chapter carefully. It will provide information that you will need later in this book.

When it comes to programming the mBot, you have three tools that you can choose from:

* mBlock
* Makeblock
* mBlock

The first one, mBlock, is a full-fledged programming environment for the mBot, and the one that allows you to take advantage of all of the mBot's capabilities. 

The other two, Makeblock and mBlock, are designed for Android and iOS tablets and meant to provide a gentle entry into the world of robotics.

Let's have a closer look at each one. 

### mBlock

The first one, mBlock is an application that runs on a Windows or Macintosh computer. Like all mBot programming options, mBlock allows you to write programs using the popular graphical programming language Scratch. In Scratch, instead of writing a program using text commands, you arrange blocks on a canvas. Each block represents a programming function. By combining together the appropriate block, you can build programs, and then upload them to your mBot. You will learn a lot about Scratch and its blocks later in this book.

A lot more about these later. Now, you can also program your mbot on a mobile device, so Ios or Android tablets or smartphones can also be used to program the mbot.

Here you've got three different choices, each one app provides or gives emphasis in a particular aspect of programming. So the first one is Make-block. With Make-block, you can create custom dashboards for your mbot, so you can create a dashboard that includes for example a joystick and a reading of the data coming out of the distance sensor and that is displayed of course on the screen of your tablet. I will be spending a bit of time showing you how to use Make-block in a separate lecture coming up. That is Make-block.

The next one is and M-block. M-block is designed for really young kids that perhaps have never had any programming experience before. Having said that, just remember that almost everything that Make-block makes and the products that they produce as educational products are really for children and people who have never used a programming language before, they have never programmed anything and that is why there is a lot of emphasis in a graphical programming language instead of classic tech-based programming language.

But the M-block app for smart-phones and tablets has got this additional gamification aspect which makes programming look more like a game than programming itself. So it will guide you through certain steps of putting those blocks together and then give you rewards and points for doing so and I will demonstrate exactly how that works in the coming up lecture in this section.

Then finally we have M-blockly. Now M-blockly looks very very similar to M-block. M-block and M-blockly are basically the same thing, in that they provide you with a programming interface that allows you to use graphical components to put together a program, that is, whatever program you want to put in there. So think of M-blockly as the tablet version of M-block.

I am going to show you what all of these apps look like in the next lecture. So I am going to show you Make-block, I am going to show you M-block and M-blockly in the next lecture and give you some examples and demonstration on how to use them and also highlight some of the restrictions. And once we are done having a look and a tour of these three apps, then I will dedicate the rest of our time in this course playing around with M-block and building up our application using M-block.
