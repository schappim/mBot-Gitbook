## Chapter 10: Demonstration of the mBlock

---

**In this chapter you will learn about:**

* What is mBlock for iOS and Android devices
* What you can you do with mBlock
* How to connect your mBot to mBlock
* How to learn Scratch programming by playing with mBlock

---

**This chapter contains hand-on activities.**

You will not need any tools.

You will need your mBot and an iPad tablet computer with the mBlock application installed.

Get mBlock from the Apple App Store \(for iOS devices\) or the Play Google Store \(for Android devices\). Find a download link at learn.makeblock.com/en/software/

If you have children in your family or if youâ€™re a teacher using this information to teach your class, then mBlock is the ideal application for children to get started with.

mBlock was designed as a game. The objective of the player is to complete a series of programming tasks, discussed as challenges. For every completed challenge, the player earns points and is presented with a new, more challenging task. 

All these tasks involve the use of Scratch blocks to control the behaviour of the mBot. This approach to learning is called "Gamification".

**Did you know?**

Gamification, the use of gaming techniques that children are already familiar with, like keeping a score, completing challenges and the like, in an environment that is typical of video games\) has been shown to significantly enhance learner's engagement with the learning program.

Start the application and it should be able to quickly detect a nearby mBot.

**Remember**: if the Bluetooth LED on the mBot is solid blue, that means that the mBot is already connected to a previous application. Switch it off and on again to reset the connection.

You will find out that this application is given in the form of a game organized in stages that you can go through, and as you follow the instructions correctly and finish each stage successfully, you earn points and rewards.

Tapping on the first one will get you in and there you should see Mr. Panda. Just tap anywhere on the screen to get Mr. Panda to go on with his instructions.

After Mr. Panda's welcoming you should see the first task: click "Play" to view mBot movements.

Tapping on "Play", on bottom right of the screen, will get the mBot to produce some actions, like buzzing and getting the motors to move a little.

Next we are going to be instructed to actually move an instruction block and place it under the other. The instructions are supplied by some explanatory animation and even a child can understand what is expected.

\[Image 2.4.3: Moving one block under another\]

Once the two blocks fit like jigsaw pieces, tap on "Play" to see them get executed. They should get the mBot to move forward for one second at a particular speed.

When done, click on "Forward" \(the orange button next to "Play"\) to get to the next task. This time we are asked to combine blocks to make the mBot first go forwards and then go backwards. All the blocks are already on the canvas, so you just need to drag the one that is out of place and lock it under the other two. When done, click on "Play" to see the mBot do as programmed. Just remember to make some space for it to move.

You get the idea, by now: this is an easy way for a person to easily learn how each of these blocks work in the format of a game. We are going to leave, as far as this chapter is concerned, but it is worth exploring further.
