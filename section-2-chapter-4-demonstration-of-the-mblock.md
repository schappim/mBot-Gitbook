## Chapter 4: Demonstration of the mBlock

In this chapter you will learn about:

* How to control the mBot using mBlock on a tablet

---

If you have children in your family or if you’re a teacher using this information to teach your class, then mBlcok is the ideal application for kids to get started with.

Start the application and it should be able to quickly detect a nearby mBot.

**Remember**: if the Bluetooth LED on the mBot is solid blue, that means that the mBot is already connected to a previous application. Switch it off and on again to reset the connection.

You will found out that this application is given in the form of a game organized in stages that you can go through, and as you follow the instructions correctly finish each stage successfully, you earn points and rewards.

Let’s go back to the very beginning and to the first one. In here we’ve got the control stage. You’ve got six problems to unlock. Let’s go to the first one and you follow the instruction. It says, “Hello, I’m Mr. Panda. Welcome to mBlock.” Tap anywhere in the screen to continue. So as you can use programs to control mBot. It’s great, give it a try.

All right. Click the triangle to view mBot movements. All right. This is the first task. My task is to press the triangle button and then that is producing a bunch of actions. It’s a bit of noise to the buzzer and the motors are moving. Great. I’ve got a win here. Let’s go to the next stage. It’s highlighting the orange button to go to the next problem.

You can combine blocks to complete the program. Great. After you complete the program click that triangle button to make it run. Okey-dokey. You can see that the game is telling me exactly what to do so the child will see that and says, “Okay, this program wants me to move these block and plug it here, right after the when the triangle is clicked.”

What these actions does, what this block does, is to move the robot forwards for one second at a particular speed, 150. Now, I’ve got to press on the triangle button to execute my little program. Here we go. Okay, for one second, win. I’ve got a few more points.

Let’s go to the next one. Now I’m asked to combine blocks to make mBot first to go forwards, then to go backwards. Okay. Now all the blocks are already on the canvas, so I just need to drag it and position this going backwards, block right after the going forwards block. Now my problem is ready, so let’s give my mBot a bit of space. Press on the triangle button to forwards and backwards. Awesome, another win. \[laughs\] Okay. Good.

Let’s go next. You get the idea, this is an easy way for a person to easily learn how each of these blocks work in the format of a game. I’m going to leave for this for you to explore further and finish with this lecture. I just want to recap a couple of things.

These three applications; Makeblock, mBlockly and mBlock are great applications to get started with. They’re not very efficient because the programs that you write are using these applications to not execute directly on to the mBot. The programs execute on you iPad and then the iPad remotely controls the mBot, and the penalty here is efficiency.

If your mBot needs to make quick decisions that involve perhaps taking readings from the sensors and then changing the speed of rotation of the motors to change direction, and if this needs to happen very quickly in order, for example, to not leave the line that the robot is following, then this is not going to be possible with one of those applications. It’s just they’re just too slow to be able to do something like that. But for many other things, these three applications are an excellent way to get started.

Having said all that, in the next section and in the remainder of this course, I will be showing you how to use the mBlock application which allows to control your mBot on your Windows or Macintosh computer. This works a lot like the Arduino, so the process there is that you write your program using the Scratch language and then that program is translated to native Arduino C code without you actually having to do anything, and then it gets uploaded on to your mBot.

What eventually you get on the mBot is Arduino code that runs at maximum speed so that you can control your mBot very efficiently, can get it to do things like that, follow a live that losing its way.

Let’s move on to the next lecture and check that out.
