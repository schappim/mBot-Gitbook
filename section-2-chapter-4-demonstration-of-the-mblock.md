## Chapter 10: Demonstration of the mBlock

---

### **In this chapter you will learn about:**

* What is mBlock for iOS and Android devices
* What you can you do with mBlock
* How to connect your mBot to mBlock
* How to learn Scratch programming by playing with mBlock

---

### **This chapter contains hand-on activities.**

You will not need any tools.

You will need your mBot and an iPad tablet computer with the mBlock application installed.

Get mBlock from the Apple App Store \(for iOS devices\) or the Play Google Store \(for Android devices\). Find a download link at learn.makeblock.com/en/software/

If you have children in your family or if youâ€™re a teacher using this information to teach your class, then mBlock is the ideal application for children to get started with.

mBlock was designed as a game. The objective of the player is to complete a series of programming tasks, discussed as challenges. For every completed challenge, the player earns points and is presented with a new, more challenging task.

All these tasks involve the use of Scratch blocks to control the behaviour of the mBot. This approach to learning is called "Gamification".

### **Did you know?**

Gamification, the use of gaming techniques that children are already familiar with, like keeping a score, completing challenges and the like, in an environment that is typical of video games\) has been shown to significantly enhance learner's engagement with the learning program.

---

Start mBlock on your iPad or Android tablet. Turn on your mBot and bring it close to your tablet. Within a few seconds, mBlock should be able to detect your mBot.

---

### **Remember**

If the Bluetooth LED on the mBot is solid blue, that means that the mBot is already connected to a previous application. Switch it off and on again to reset the connection.

---

Once the connection between the mBot and mBlock is established, you will see a screen like the one in Image 2.4.1. Each one of the boxes represents a challenge that the learner can attempt.

Tap on the first box. You should see Mr. Panda, who is your teacher \(see Image 2.4.2\). Mr. Panda will explain the objective of each challenge and help you achieve the required goal. Just tap anywhere on the screen to prompt Mr. Panda to go on with his instructions.

After Mr. Panda's welcoming message, he will give you your first task. Tap on the "Play" button to view mBot movements.

Tapping on "Play", on bottom right of the screen, will get the mBot to produce some actions, like buzzing and getting the motors to move \(see Image 2.4.3\).

\[Image 2.4.3: Your first task is to tap on the blue Play button\]

Well done, you completed your first task! 

Next, Mr Panda will ask you to move an instruction block and place it under the other. The instructions are supplied by some explanatory animation so it should be fairly obvious to understand how to complete any task.

\[Image 2.4.4: Moving one block under another\]

Once the two blocks hook against each other like jigsaw pieces, tap on "Play" to see the program you just assembled executed. The program will cause the mBot to move forward for one second at speed 150.

When you have completed this task, click on "Forward" \(the orange button next to "Play"\) to get to the next task \(see Image 2.4.5\). This time we are asked to combine blocks to make the mBot first go forwards and then go backwards. All the blocks are already on the canvas, so you just need to drag the one that is out of place and lock it under the other two. When done, click on "Play" to see the mBot do as programmed. Just remember to make some space on your desk for your mBot to move without hitting anything or falling off the table!

By now you should have a good understanding of what mBlock for tablets does. mBlock is a fun way for a student to learn mBot programming using Scratch.
