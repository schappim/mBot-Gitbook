## Chapter 4: Demonstration of the mBlock

---

In this chapter you will learn about:

* How to control the mBot using mBlock on a tablet

---

If you have children in your family or if youâ€™re a teacher using this information to teach your class, then mBlcok is the ideal application for kids to get started with.

Start the application and it should be able to quickly detect a nearby mBot.

**Remember**: if the Bluetooth LED on the mBot is solid blue, that means that the mBot is already connected to a previous application. Switch it off and on again to reset the connection.

You will found out that this application is given in the form of a game organized in stages that you can go through, and as you follow the instructions correctly finish each stage successfully, you earn points and rewards.

Tapping on the first one will get you in and there you should see Mr. Panda. Just tap anywhere on the screen to get Mr. Panda to go on with his instructions.

After Mr. Panda's welcoming you should see the first task: Click "Play" to view mBot movements.

Tapping on "Play", on bottom right of the screen, will get the mBot to produce some actions, like buzzing and getting the motors to move a little.

Next we are going to be instructed to actually move an instruction block and place it under the other. The instructions are supplied by some explanatory animation and even a child can understand what is expected.

Once the two blocks fit like jigsaw pieces, tap on "Play" to see them get executed. They should get the mBot to move forward for one second at a particular speed.

When done, click on "Forward" \(the orange button next to "Play"\) to get to the next task. This time we are asked to combine blocks to make the mBot first to go forwards and then to go backwards. All the blocks are already on the canvas, so you just need to drag the one that is out of place and lock it under the other two. When done, click on "Play" to see the mBot do as programmed. Just remember to make some space for it to move.

You get the idea, by now: this is an easy way for a person to easily learn how each of these blocks work in the format of a game. We are going to leave it here but you should explore it further.
