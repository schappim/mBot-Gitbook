## Chapter 34: Restoring the default program {#chapter-34-restoring-the-default-program}

---

In this chapter you will learn about:

* How to restore the default program on your mBot

---

**This chapter contains hands-on activities.**

You will need your mBot, and a fresh set of batteries installed.

You will need the mBlock software installed on your computer.

You will need the infrared remote controller the came with the kit if you wish to play with the demonstration programs.

In this chapter you will learn how to restore the default program on your mBot. By doing so, you will be able to connect your mBot to your iPad or Android tablet device, use the infrared remote controller, and play with the build-in demonstration programs \(as you did in Chapter 5\).

---

In the small experiment you did at the start of the previous chapter, you confirmed that the remote control does not work if you upload your custom program to the mBot. The remote controller is also not working after restoring the original firmware to the mBot.

To regain all of the functionality that your mBot had when you took it out of its box, you will need to upload the default program. Here are the steps that you can follow in order to restore the factory default program:

1. First, connect the USB cable to the mBot.
2. In the Connect menu item, select the appropriate serial port to which your mBot is connected.
3. Again in the Connect menu, expand the Reset Default Program option and click on "mBot" \(see Image 6.34.1\). This will start the very quick upload process will start.
4. When finished disconnect your mBot from your computer.

\[Image 6.34.1: Step 3: Reseting to the default program\]

Restart your mBot and test it with your infrared remote control.

Press the key marked "A". This will allow you to use the arrow keys on the remote controller to get your mBot to move around.

Press the key marked "B". This will make the mBot avoid obstacles in front of it. Place it on the floor and watch it as it changes course when it moves near an obstacle.

Press the key marked "C". This will make the mBot to work as a line follower, similar to the behaviour of the program you composed.

Now that you have confirmed that the remote controller is working, try to connect your mBot to your tablet and use one of the tablet applications.

The connection process should work without any issues. The blue LED on the Bluetooth model should be solid. If you are having any problems with the connection process, turn off and then back on your mBot in order to reset the Bluetooth module, and try the process again.

_Answer: The firmware only provides the functionality necessary for your mBot to connect to your table device so that you can use the tablet apps. The default program provides all the functionality of the firmware as well as the ability to use the infrared remote control._
