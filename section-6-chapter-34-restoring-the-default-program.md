In this chapter you will learn about:

* How to restore the default program on your mBot

---

**This chapter contains hands-on activities.**

You will need your mBot, and a fresh set of batteries installed.

You will need the mBlock software installed on your computer.

In this chapter you will learn how to restore the default program on your mBot. By doing so, you will be able to connect your mBot to your iPad or Android tablet device, use the infrared remote controller, and try out the build-in demonstration programs.

We saw, in the previous chapter, that the remote control isn't working, after uploading the original firmware to the mBot.

Here are the steps that you can follow in order to restore the factory default program so that your remote control can operate again.

1. First, connect the USB cable to the mBot.
2. Then, go to menu Connect 
   &gt;
    Serial Port and make sure the right serial port is checked, there.
3. Then, go to Connect 
   &gt;
    Reset Default Program

Next, let's use the default program to connect to one of the tablet applications.

so I'll go back to make block.

The blue LED on the Bluetooth model is solid, so it's trying to find a net block device. It's not able to find it because of the state of the Bluetooth module, so I'm going to try to turn off nCore and turn it back on. Go back to get my Bluetooth module back into discovering mode. You can see that the device found now can be closer and connected. There we go. That's the difference between firmware option and the default program option. With the default program option you are able to use your remote control and trigger the three little programs that are stored inside this default program, but you can also use it to connect your nBot to your tablet device, and use one of the tablet applications to play around with your NBot.
