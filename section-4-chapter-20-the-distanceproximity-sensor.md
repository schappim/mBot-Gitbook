## Chapter 21: The distance/proximity sensor

In this chapter you will learn about:

* How the distance/proximity sensor operates
* How to program the distance/proximity sensor

With the two LEDs blissfully blinking away forever, the next thing that we are going to handle is the proximity sensor.

### Operation of a distance/proximity sensor

The proximity sensor allows us to measure the distance between the mBot and an object in front of it. The sensor works well in a reasonable distance up to 30 or 40 centimetres. The further away you go from the object, the larger the object has to be in order for the sensor to pick up the distance correctly. You will find, for example, that a pen might be too small for the sensor to be able to recognize it and to measure the distance from it. A larger object with a flat surface, like a book, makes a better target for this kind of sensor. The principle of operation is the same by which a sonar works for a submarine. The sensor contains two main components:

* the **transmitter**, which them emits out a bleep: an ultrasonic sound which is going to reach the object, bounce off it and then come back
* the **receiver**, which listens out for those bounced signals.

Internally the sensor will calculate the amount of time that it takes for the signal to travel to the obstacle and then to come back. From that information, it will work out the distance in centimetres or inches, or a measuring unit which you can control.

### Programming the sensor

Let's create a new project in order to see how the ultrasonic distance sensor works: File &gt; New

As always, we start by placing the mBot program header on the canvas. Next, we drag and drop an "ultrasonic sensor ... distance" on the canvas. We will notice that this block does not have the indentation that allows it to connect to the mBot program header block.

Blocks with rounded corners, like this one, are meant to return a value. One way to use such a block is to place it within a "set variable" block, assigning the returned value to some variable.

Let's create, therefore, a new variable: Data&Blocks &gt; Make Variable

and give it the name "distance".

Next step, we drag "set distance to ..." and attach it below the header bock. And now we can move the "ultrasonic sensor ... distance" block and make it the second attribute of "set distance to ..." like shown in the image below:

\[Image 4.21.1: Assigning the ultrasonic sensor reading to variable "distance"\]

If your ultrasonic sensor is connected to some other port than Port3, you should change this attribute accordingly.

Next, we add a "set led on board ..." block, attach it to the program and place variable "distance" in all the three attribute places:

![](/assets/Img.4.21.2.jpg)

\[Image 4.21.2: Setting the LEDs to emit a quantity of light corresponding to the distance from the object\]

Î¤he problem, here, is that these two instruction blocks will only execute once and then the program will stop, meaning we are going to take just one single measurement with the sensor, which is not ideal. With a sensor, typically, you want to take multiple measurements because you want your robot to continue sensing change in the environment. In order to have these two instructions execute repeatedly we need to place them within a loop. So, let's add a forever loop, and arrange the blocks, by moving them around, to achieve the order shown here below:

![](/assets/Img.4.21.3.jpg)

\[Image 4.21.3: The final program\]

**Note**: The colour of the blocks can direct you to the category where you can find each block.

The idea here is that as the distance from the object increases, the brightness of the LEDs will decrease. As the distance from the object decreases, the brightness will increase accordingly. Now that our program is complete we can test it in practice.

We make sure that we've got a COM port connected and then "Upload to Arduino".

We place some object in front of the sensor, like a book, and then slowly move it closer to the sensor and back again. We notice that the intensity of the LEDs grows stronger or fainter, depending on the distance between the object and the sensor.

When there is no object before the mBot, or when the object is too close to the sensor, we will notice that the LEDs will be at the brightest setting. The reason for this is that in both cases there can be no reading. The signal either doesn't return or, when we are too close, there is just not enough space for the signal to travel from the transmitter to the object and back to the receiver.

**Note**: The absolute closest you can have your target against a sensor is about one centimetre.

Let's not forget to save the program: File &gt; Save Project and then type the name: "introduction to the distance sensor".

### A different exercise

Next, let's load the program we saved in the previous chapter, named "forever loop alternating the LEDs with variable", and make some changes to it. As described in the previous chapter, to load we go to: File &gt; Load program and pick our saved program in the "choose file to open" window.

Now, let's alter the program, by discarding blocks and inserting new ones, until we have it the way it is shown in the image, below. In order to discard a block, we just drag and drop it outside the programming canvas.

![](/assets/Img.4.21.4.jpg)

\[Image 4.21.4: The new version of the program\]

The idea is that the LEDs blink with a frequency that corresponds to the distance of some object caught by the ultrasonic sensor.

Here's what happens: left LED is turned on while right LED is turned off and we leave things that way for distance \* 0.01 seconds. Then left LED is turned off while right LED is turned on and again we wait for distance \* 0.01 seconds. And that over and over again, since it is placed in a forever loop. And that is what we call blinking.

But why multiply with 0.1? Imagine the distance of the object being, say, 30 cm. Obviously, it wouldn't be much of a blinking to have the LED stay turned on for 30 seconds, would it? Therefore, we need to multiply it with some decimal value.

**Note**: Distance readings of the sensor are in centimetres.

Now we can "Upload to Arduino" and test our program. Let's pick a suitable obstacle, like a book, place it before the sensor and try different distances. The closer we bring it to the mBot, the faster the LEDs blink, and the further away we take it from the mBot, the blinking rate decreases.

This was just another example of how we can get input from sensors and then manipulate that input arithmetically in order to produce a desired behaviour. We are going to work more with the ultrasonic sensor later on in this crash course. For the time being, let's move on and talk about the if and if-else control structure.

### Exercises

Exercise 4.21.1: Modify the program shown in image 4.21.3 so that the LEDs have the opposite behaviour: their intensity increases, instead of decreasing, as the target object is getting closer, and vice versa.
