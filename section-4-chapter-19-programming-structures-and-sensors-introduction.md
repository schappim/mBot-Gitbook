## Chapter 19: Programming structures and sensors

### This chapter is a an introduction to a new section {#this-chapter-is-a-recap-of-what-you-have-learned-so-far}

There are no hands-on activities in this chapter.

In this section you will learn how to use two essential programming control structures using Scratch:

* the "loop"
* the "if...else"

With the loop structure, you can repeat the execution of the same segment of your program multiple times. You can either decide how many times you want to repeat a segment of the program when you are writing the program, or get the program to decide itself based on some external condition \(like the reading of a variable\), or other parameter.

With the "if...else" structure, your program can make decisions. You can use this structure, for example, to program your mBot to strop **if** it detects an obstacle ahead of it, or to continue to move **if** there is no obstacle.

In addition, you will learn how to use a proximity sensor to detect obstacles and the buzzer for making noises.
